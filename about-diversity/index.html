<p>Diversity is a word we are hearing more and more in the Enterprise world as well as in media. Hopefully for the best, as talking and debating about a social problem is likely to drive progress.</p>
<p>To be honest, I was not really aware of this topic until I became a manager. Four years ago, when I got promoted to lead a team, I focused on getting to know my people, creating an environment where they could thrive and deliver great performance.</p>
<p>Then, by knowing more each individual and trying to foster creativity among the group, I realized that something was wrong. I mean, the team was doing great but something was missing. This team was comprised of 4 white males with all the same background, 20+ experience, most of those years working for similar companies (software vendors), good skills, same nationality (Swiss) and same mother tongue (Swiss German). Nothing wrong about that&hellip;</p>
<p>My background was a bit different: 10 years younger on average, French, not speaking a single word of German (let alone Swiss German&hellip;) and first experience working for a software vendor.</p>
<p>I felt like the &ldquo;stranger&rdquo; and the one pushing new ideas, exploring other approaches and willing to disrupt for the better.</p>
<p>I slowly started to think about it and search for articles on the Internet or videos (TED is always a good source).</p>
<p>I found this <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-diversity-makes-us-smarter">article</a> published on ScientificAmerican very compelling and it resonated very well with some of my intuitions.</p>
<p>When the time came to hire a new person on the team, I desperately looked for a new profile. Very difficult to find&hellip; Switzerland is a great country that I love a lot, equally, it is still very conservative in the business. I did not get any application from women or people with a different origin.</p>
<p>Last year, I relocated to the United States, more precisely in San Francisco where diversity is a reality.</p>
<p>I have experienced it here myself as my team is comprised of people with different origins, background, experience, and age. But all men&hellip;</p>
<p>We are doing great together and I really value all our team meetings where we brainstorm together and plan next activities. We are all coming from a different angle and we exchange our ideas. That&rsquo;s really a great experience for me.</p>
<p>However, I have still the same problem. How can I attract women in the team? Last time, I had a new opening in the team, I got only 50+ male and only 2 female applying: one was a waitress with absolutely no experience nor diplomas (nothing wrong but she did not read the job description) and the other one was simply not a good match (bad attitude, condescending&hellip;).</p>
<p>Back in January, I attended a seminar about diversity. It was hosted at Lyft which promotes diversity and organized by Eva Hel√©n (<a href="https://twitter.com/ehelen">@ehelen</a>), Founder and CEO, <a href="http://eqinspiration.com/">EQ Inspiration</a>.</p>
<p>There were several speakers sharing their experience including males promoting diversity. It gave me even more confidence that it is the way to go.</p>
<p>I wonder how to make that happen now. I have a new open position in the team, I&rsquo;ll do my best to promote it to different Evangelistas who hopefully will be able to relay and help me finding the right profile!</p>
