          <p>December 31st. There are few hours left before the New Year, kids are having a nap, house is quiet. Probably the right time to reflect upon 2017, another crazy year with so many things that happened. Time also to thank people for what they did.</p>
<h1 id="goodbye-2017httpsimgover-blog-kiwicom212276820171231ob_e7b39e_ragnar-vorel-351405jpghttpsimgover-blog-kiwicom212276820171231ob_e7b39e_ragnar-vorel-351405jpg-the-move"><a href="https://img.over-blog-kiwi.com/2/12/27/68/20171231/ob_e7b39e_ragnar-vorel-351405.jpg"><img src="https://img.over-blog-kiwi.com/2/12/27/68/20171231/ob_e7b39e_ragnar-vorel-351405.jpg" alt="Goodbye 2017!"></a> <strong>The move:</strong></h1>
<p>My wife and I had been discussing a potential relocation for many years and in July 2016, she came home one day and announced: &ldquo;Honey, I am ready. Let&rsquo;s have another life somewhere else&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Our place was a beautiful one, Annecy, France - also called &ldquo;Venice of the Alps&rdquo;. Surrounded by mountains, with a gorgeous lake, a lovely city 30 min away from Geneva, Switzerland where I worked for more than 10 years. We had a great house that we renovated, old farm. We had good friends, kids were happy.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we wanted to experience something new and discover different cultures. Since I was working for a US company (and still am) - Riverbed Technology - , we decided that asking a relocation to the US was the easiest way for us. So I did. My boss was incredibly supportive and after applying internally to several positions, I was finally proposed to build &amp; lead a team of Evangelists in our HQ in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Thank you Riverbed for this incredible opportunity and Mr Price for his support &amp; coaching.</p>
<p>An international move is not so easy: lots of paperwork, we decided to sell our house, wife sold her business. We sold so many things (cars, furniture, bikes, beds&hellip;), it was really intense. LeBonCoin, a Craig&rsquo;s List like, was really helpful for that. I left end of September, alone, time to find a place, schools for kids, discover San Francisco and start my new job.</p>
<p>Wife was taking care of everything in France i.e. a lot! Thank you Wife to believe in me, support me, take care of our family and stay with me!</p>
<p>Mid November I went back &ldquo;home&rdquo; and we left all together this time to our &ldquo;New Life&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So far, so good. Really exciting to be here and so many things to discover. Plus on the professional side, being in the Silicon Valley is a dream! So many interesting people, so many ideas, so much potential to create something big!</p>
<p><a href="https://img.over-blog-kiwi.com/2/12/27/68/20171231/ob_bd879f_amazon-web-services-logo-aws.png"><img src="https://img.over-blog-kiwi.com/2/12/27/68/20171231/ob_bd879f_amazon-web-services-logo-aws.png" alt="Goodbye 2017!"></a> On the technical side, I invested a lot of time on AWS. Over the past 4 years, I often played with services offered by the Cloud provider and end of 2016, I started to really go deeper.</p>
<p>I played with the <a href="http://www.rjourdan.net/2017/05/my-first-alexa-skill.html">Alexa Skill Kit</a> and this is when I discovered the concept of Serverless with AWS Lambda. Wahoo, this thing is really exciting! Now, when I have an idea, it&rsquo;s much easier to develop it as I don&rsquo;t need to provision a server, install an application server, tune it, publish it on the web etc&hellip; Everything is done for me, the only focus I have is writing the code to be executed! How cool is that???!!!!</p>
<p>I am developing a serverless demo platform at the moment to show the potential of SDWAN &amp; Cloud Networking</p>
<p>I am still learning and experimenting new things. I have more ideas and hopefully new concepts to share in 2018&hellip;.</p>
<p>AWS Green Grass is another exciting technology that delivers Lambda at the edge, mainly for the Internet of Things. Really really cool!</p>
<p>I also spent a lot of time to prepare AWS certifications, a good way to learn with a target in mind.</p>
<p>Thanks A Cloud Guru and Ryan Kroonenburg for their trainings. I feel really inspired by what you have been able to achieve in few years thanks to the Cloud and your dedication! Great job!</p>
<p><a href="https://img.over-blog-kiwi.com/2/12/27/68/20171231/ob_631e2b_nordwood-themes-467442.jpg"><img src="https://img.over-blog-kiwi.com/2/12/27/68/20171231/ob_631e2b_nordwood-themes-467442.jpg" alt="Goodbye 2017!"></a> I could write again during hours and try to summarise 2017. But the focus is now on 2018 and I&rsquo;d like to share what I will work on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build a team of Evangelists, create an environment where people can thrive and make an impact.</li>
<li>Make Riverbed the leader in SDWAN &amp; Cloud Networking through innovation and customer focus</li>
<li>Publish a demo platform using Serverless concepts (Function as a Service, Database, Auth0&hellip;)</li>
<li>Continue to learn AWS capabilities and leverage them for my work (and pleasure)</li>
<li>Refresh my Python and node.js skills</li>
<li>Write more often&hellip;.</li>
</ul>
<p>Happy New Year!</p>
